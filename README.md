Problem statement: 

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion



Data Reading/Data Understanding 


Dataset Creation

Dataset visualisation 

Model Building & training : 

Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training

Train the model for ~20 epochs

Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve 
underfitting/overfitting 

Model Building & training on the augmented data :

Create a CNN model

Train the model for ~20 epochs

Write your findings after the model fit, see if the earlier issue is resolved or not?

Class distribution:

Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training

Train the model for ~30 epochs

Write your findings after the model fit, see if the issues are resolved or not?
